**Step 1**: Load here and rio packages

```{r setup}
library(here)
library(rio)
```

**Step 2**: Export mtcars data set to multiple file formats

```{r}
export(mtcars, here("demo", "data", "mtcars.csv"))
export(mtcars, here("demo", "data", "mtcars.rds"))
export(mtcars, here("demo", "data", "mtcars2.csv.zip"))
```

Notice that we don't need to worry about using different functions for exporting to different file formats!

**Step 3**: Import data sets

```{r}
mtcars_csv <- import(here("demo", "data", "mtcars.csv"))
mtcars_rds <- import(here("demo", "data", "mtcars.rds"))
mtcars_zip <- import(here("demo", "data", "mtcars2.csv.zip"))

nrow(mtcars_csv)
nrow(mtcars_rds)
nrow(mtcars_zip)
```

Similar to export, we don't need to use different functions for importing data of different types!
