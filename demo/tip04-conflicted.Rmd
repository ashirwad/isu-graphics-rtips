**Step 1**: Load conflicted and dplyr packages

```{r setup}
library(conflicted) # always keep it on top
library(dplyr)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
```

**Step 2**: Filter data in mtcars data set

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  filter(cyl == 4)
```

Notice that the conflicted package identified that filter function is available in 2 packages and wants us to explicitly declare which one we want to use.

**Step 3**: Go to **Step 1** and declare the winner. Then rerun **Step 2**.

Notice that the error is now gone.
