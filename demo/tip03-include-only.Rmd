**Step 1**: Load magrittr package

```{r}
library(tidyr) # automatically attaches the pipe operator
library(magrittr, include.only = c("%$%", "%<>%"))
```

Notice that calling library() loads the whole namespace and causes unnecessary namespace conflicts!

**Step 2**: Since we only need a couple of functions from magrittr, go to **Step 1** and only load those functions

You will need to restart the R session after **Step 2** and then run the first chunk. Notice that the message on object masking is no longer there.
