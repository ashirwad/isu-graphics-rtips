**Step 1**: Load *here* and *tidyverse* packages

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

**Step 2**: Import air quality data set

```{r air-quality, cache = TRUE, cache.extra = file.mtime(here("demo", "data", "airquality.csv"))}
air_quality <- read_csv(here("demo", "data", "airquality.csv"))

# Get the number of rows
nrow(air_quality)
```

Notice that updating the *airquality.csv* file does not invalidate the *air-quality* code chunk. The number of rows still shows 153 even when the file has 306 rows!

**Step 3**: Go back to **Step 2** and add *cache.extra* chunk option to introduce cache dependency on the file

Notice that the number of rows is now computed correctly.
