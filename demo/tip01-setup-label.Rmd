**Step 1**: Load magrittr package

```{r setup}
library(magrittr)
```

**Step 2**: Use the pipe operator to get the number of rows in the mtcars data set

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  nrow()
```

Notice that running **Step 2** without running **Step 1** throws error. It is expected because this pipe operator is not available in base R.

**Step 3**: Go back to **Step 1**, rename the chunk to *setup* (DO NOT RUN IT), and then perform **Step 2**

Notice that RStudio now automatically runs the *setup* chunk before running the chunk in **Step 2**
